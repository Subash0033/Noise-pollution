*Noise Pollution Monitoring* 

*Project Definition*: 

The  Noise  Pollution  Monitoring  project  aims  to  address  the  growing concern of noise pollution in public areas by utilizing Internet of Things (IOT) sensors. These sensors will be deployed to measure noise levels continuously and provide real-time data accessible to the public through a platform or mobile app. The primary objective of this project is to raise awareness  about  noise  pollution  and  empower  informed  decision- making. Phase 1 involves defining the project's objectives, designing the IOT sensor system, developing the noise pollution information platform, and planning the integration using IOT technology and Python.
